##### Q1 In the `safeTransferFrom` function, what does `0x23b872dd000000000000000000000000` represent and what does it mean when used in the following context on line 192: `mstore(0x0c, 0x23b872dd000000000000000000000000)`.?

`0x23b872dd000000000000000000000000` funcsig `transferFrom(address,address,uint256)`
store value `0x23b872dd000000000000000000000000` at location`0x0c (12)`

#

##### Q2 In the `safeTransferFrom` function, why is `shl` used on line 191 to shift the `from` to the left by 96 bits?

move `from address` value from `0x2c` to `0x20` next to function signature at `0x1c`

#

##### Q3 In the `safeTransferFrom` function, is this memory safe assembly? Why or why not?

although it can be considered safe as `0x60` was temporarily used but reset it deviates from best practices

#

##### Q4 In the `safeTransferFrom` function, on line 197, why is `0x1c` provided as the 4th argument to `call`?

it contains start of function signature (`transferFrom(address,address,uint256)`).
from 0x1c next 100 bytes contains abi-encoded low level call.

#

##### Q5 In the `safeTransfer` function, on line 266, why is `revert` used with `0x1c` and `0x04`?

starting at 0x1c onwards 4 bytes are `90b8ec18` which refers to `transferFailed()` error which is given as revert reason.

#

##### Q6 In the `safeTransfer` function, on line 268, why is `0` mstoreâ€™d at `0x34`.?

when `mstore(0x34, amount)` is called it also writes at regions `0x40 to 0x54` which belongs to the free memory pointer(`0x40`). `mstore(0x34, 0)` is used to overwrite that region back with zeroes.

#

##### Q7 In the `safeApprove` function, on line 317, why is `mload(0x00)` validated for equality to 1?

it is checking for successfull return after calling approve function.

#

##### Q8 In the `safeApprove` function, if the `token` returns `false` from the `approve(address,uint256)` function, what happens?

It will revert with `ApproveFailed()` Error.
